[role_profile_interview]
role-profile-name = Enter a unique name for the role profile.  Role profiles are required when defining a host template.
role-du-host-type = Since this region supports both PMO and PMK hosts, you must specify how this node wil be used with the region.
role-pmo-glance = Select this option if you want to install OpenStack Glance (OS Image Library) on this host when it is on-boarded to a region.
role-pmo-cinder = Select this option if you want to install OpenStack Cinder (Storage Orchestration) on this host when it is on-boarded to a region.
role-pmo-designate = Select this option if you want to install OpenStack Designate (DNS Integration) on this host when it is on-boarded to a region.
role-k8s-node-type = Select the Kubernetes node type for this host.

[auth_profile_interview]
auth-profile-name = Enter a unique name for the authorization profile.  Auth profiles are required when defining a host template.
auth-profile-type = Enter the authentication type.  You can specify a username/password pair or a username/key pair.
auth-profile-username = Enter the username for remote SSH access.
auth-profile-password = Enter the password for remote SSH access.  Applies only if you selected 'simple' for authentication type.
auth-profile-key = Enter the path on on the local filesystem to the SSH private key for remoge SSH access.  Applies only if you selected 'sshkey' for authentication type.


[cluster_interview]
cluster-name = Enter the name for the Kubernetes cluster.  NOTE: it must not already exist.
containers-cidr = Defaults to 10.20.0.0/16. The CIDR for containers running on your cluster (Specified in CIDR format. Example - 192.0.2.0/24). Kubernetes uses this CIDR to route packets between pods or containers in the cluster. You should specify an unused subnet here. And this subnet should be treated as Kubernetes internal subnet. Make sure that your network equipment does not route or otherwise is aware of this subnet.
services-cird = Defaults to 10.21.0.0/16. The CIDR for services running on your cluster. (Specified in CIDR format. Example - 192.0.2.0/24). Kubernetes uses this CIDR to route packets between the services in the cluster. You should specify an unused subnet here. And this subnet should be treated as Kubernetes internal subnet. Make sure that your network equipment does not route or otherwise is aware of this subnet.
master-vip = IP address for VIP for master nodes. Required if you are creating a multi-master cluster. For more about VPI, read https://docs.platform9.com/kubernetes/multimaster-architecture-platform9-managed-kubernetes
interface-name-vip = Name of the network interface on this node on which the VIP should bind to. Required if you are creating a multi-master cluster. For a single master cluster, VIP is optional. Make sure that the virtual IP specified above is accessible on this network interface, and that all master nodes use the same interface name for the interface to be associated with the virtual IP.
ip-range-metallb = IP range for MetalLB (specified in 'Start IP - End IP' range format). You should specify this value if you would like to use MetalLB as an option for service load balancing. For more information about MetalLB, read https://docs.platform9.com/kubernetes/pmk-load-balancing-with-metallb
priviliged-mode = Defaults to True. Specify if the cluster should be enabled to run privileged containers. Note that being able to run privileged containers within the cluster is a prerequisite if you wish to enable service type loadbalancer using MetalLB. By default a container is not allowed to access any devices on the host, but a 'privileged' container is given access to all devices on the host. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#privileged
enable-helm-catalog = Defaults to False. Enable Helm application catalog for the cluster
enable-master-workloads = Defaults to False. Specify if you wish to allow workloads to run on the master nodes. Setting it to true would mean both master and worker nodes will be used to schedule workloads on. Note that for production clusters, we recommend you do not run workloads on the master nodes, but instead allocate sufficient capacity on the worker nodes to run your applications. This ensures that the master nodes will have sufficient resources to keep the cluster running.
select-cluster = Select the cluster to attach the node to (as either a master or worker) the next time you run 'Onbard Hosts to Region'
