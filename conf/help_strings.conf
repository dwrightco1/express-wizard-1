[region_interview]
add-region = Select a region to take under management -OR- to update and/or discover.  By selecting an existing reqion, you will be able to update all of the settings and re-discover the region, or just re-discover the region.  Discovering a region involves querying the Platform9 Control Plane to for hosts/clusters.  By selecting 'n', you can define a new region.
region-op = You can update the Region Settings and perform Discovery, or you can run Discover only.
select-region = Select a region to operate against.
discover-region = When a region is discovered, REST APIs on the Platform9 Management Plane will be queried to discover existing PMO/PMK hosts (i.e. a host with the pf9-hostagent installed/running), existing PMK clusters, as well as the relationships and attachment status for those clusters.

region-type = Select the region type.  The region type is established by Platform9 when creating the management plane.  This setting controls what type of hosts (PMO/PMK) can be added to the region.  NOTE: if you set the region type to 'KVM/Kubernetes', both types of hosts can be added, and clusters can be added and discovered. 
region-username = Enter the username for logging in to the Platform9 Management Plane.  For example, admin@platform9.net
region-password = Enter the password for logging in to the Platform9 Management Plane.  NOTE: passwords are encrypted when storing in the underlying database.

[onboard_interview]
attach-masters = Select 'y' to attach master node(s) to the selected cluster. For new clusters, you must select 'y' for this option - since at least one master node is required before attaching worker nodes.  For existing clusters (i.e. clusters that have already been onboarded), you attach additional master nodes if needed.
select-masters = Enter the master node(s) to attach to the cluster just selected.  NOTE: if not selecting 'all', you can enter a single hostname - or a list of hostnames seperated by spaces/commas.
attach-workers = Select 'y' to attach worker node(s) to the selected cluster.
select-workers = Enter the worker node(s) to attach to the selected cluster.  NOTE: if not selecting 'all', you can enter a single hostname - or a list of hostnames seperated by spaces/commas.
express-prereqs = This step installs prerequisite packages/configurations.  NOTE: this step only needs to be run once, after which it can be safely skipped.
run-express = This step launches PF9-Express against the selected node(s), which uses Ansible to install the Platform9 Hostagent and associated roles.
run-express-cli = This step launches PF9-Express-CLI against the selected node(s) to orchestrate the cluster attachment process.  During this process, master/worker nodes undergo a 'convergence' process that can take about 10 minutes to complete.
select-inventory = The inventory specifies which specific host or host-group will be targeted during on-boarding. The groups listed correspond to the group designations in the 'Inventory File' for the region being on-boarded.  The Inventory File is available to viewed from the 'Mainetenance Menu'.
custom-inventory = This option lets you specify a specific list of hosts to target during on-boarding.  For multiple hosts, uses spaces/commas to seperate hostnames.  NOTE: the hosts you specify must be listed in the 'Inventory File' for the selected region.  The Inventory File is available to viewed from the 'Mainetenance Menu'.
role-assignment = This option allows you to control Platform9 role assignment.  If you select Option 1, the Platform9 Host Agent will be installed, the host will register with your Platform9 Control Plane, and the host will be available in the Platform9 UI for role assigment.  If you select Option 2, the Platform9 Host Agent will be installed, the host will register with your Platform9 Control Plane, and all Platform9 roles will be assigned automatically.

select-cluster = Select an existing cluster to attach master and/or worker nodes to.  The cluster and nodes must already have been defined.  During this process, the master node(s) will be attached first and will undergo a 'convergence' process that can take about 10 minutes to complete, after which the worker node(s) will undergo a similar convergence process.
containers-cidr = Defaults to 10.20.0.0/16. The CIDR for containers running on your cluster (Specified in CIDR format. Example - 192.0.2.0/24). Kubernetes uses this CIDR to route packets between pods or containers in the cluster. You should specify an unused subnet here. And this subnet should be treated as Kubernetes internal subnet. Make sure that your network equipment does not route or otherwise is aware of this subnet.
services-cird = Defaults to 10.21.0.0/16. The CIDR for services running on your cluster. (Specified in CIDR format. Example - 192.0.2.0/24). Kubernetes uses this CIDR to route packets between the services in the cluster. You should specify an unused subnet here. And this subnet should be treated as Kubernetes internal subnet. Make sure that your network equipment does not route or otherwise is aware of this subnet.
master-vip = IP address for VIP for master nodes. Required if you are creating a multi-master cluster. For more about VPI, read https://docs.platform9.com/kubernetes/multimaster-architecture-platform9-managed-kubernetes
interface-name-vip = Name of the network interface on this node on which the VIP should bind to. Required if you are creating a multi-master cluster. For a single master cluster, VIP is optional. Make sure that the virtual IP specified above is accessible on this network interface, and that all master nodes use the same interface name for the interface to be associated with the virtual IP.
ip-range-metallb = IP range for MetalLB (specified in 'Start IP - End IP' range format). You should specify this value if you would like to use MetalLB as an option for service load balancing. For more information about MetalLB, read https://docs.platform9.com/kubernetes/pmk-load-balancing-with-metallb
priviliged-mode = Defaults to True. Specify if the cluster should be enabled to run privileged containers. Note that being able to run privileged containers within the cluster is a prerequisite if you wish to enable service type loadbalancer using MetalLB. By default a container is not allowed to access any devices on the host, but a 'privileged' container is given access to all devices on the host. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#privileged
enable-helm-catalog = Defaults to False. Enable Helm application catalog for the cluster
enable-master-workloads = Defaults to False. Specify if you wish to allow workloads to run on the master nodes. Setting it to true would mean both master and worker nodes will be used to schedule workloads on. Note that for production clusters, we recommend you do not run workloads on the master nodes, but instead allocate sufficient capacity on the worker nodes to run your applications. This ensures that the master nodes will have sufficient resources to keep the cluster running.
